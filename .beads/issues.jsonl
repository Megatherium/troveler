Unnecessary regex in eget transformation (lines 40-46)\n   - Currently uses regex `^eget\\\\s+(.+)$` for simple prefix matching\n   - Should use strings.CutPrefix for consistency with go/cargo patterns\n\n2. Typo/formatting in go install pattern (line 12)\n   - Missing space after `:=`: `if after, ok :=strings.CutPrefix(...)`\n\n3. Missing edge case tests\n   - eget foo (single segment repo)\n   - eget foo/bar/baz (too many segments)\n   - eget foo/bar --version 1.0 (flags after repo)\n\nFixes required:\n- Replace eget regex with strings.CutPrefix + strings.Fields logic\n- Fix typo in line 12\n- Add edge case tests to test coverage","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T14:25:47.144024851+01:00","created_by":"Megatherium","updated_at":"2026-02-11T14:29:37.4370323+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T14:29:37.4370323+01:00","close_reason":"Refinement complete - fixed typo, replaced regex with strings.CutPrefix, added edge case tests","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"troveler-67w","depends_on_id":"troveler-73y","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-02-11T14:25:55.825150776+01:00","created_by":"Megatherium"}]}
