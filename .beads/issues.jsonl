This review covers changes from tickets: troveler-bdt, troveler-dhg, and troveler-iwv.\n\nChanges include:\n\n**Ticket troveler-bdt: Virtual install instructions generation**\n1. Added GenerateVirtualInstallInstructions() in internal/install/commands.go\n2. Updated showAllInstalls() in commands/install.go to show virtuals\n3. Updated runInfo() in commands/info.go to show virtuals\n4. Updated SetTool() in tui/panels/install.go to show virtuals\n5. Added comprehensive tests in internal/install/install_test.go\n\nKey implementation details:\n- Generates mise: platforms (mise:go, mise:cargo, mise:npm, mise:pipx, mise:github)\n- Handles duplicates (npm/yarn/pnpm → single mise:npm)\n- Skips existing mise:* platforms\n- Returns results in deterministic order\n\n**Ticket troveler-dhg: CLI override priority over mise mode**\n1. commands/install.go: Only force cliOverride='LANG' when mise enabled AND no CLI override provided\n2. tui/panels/install.go: Same fix for TUI panel\n3. Added comprehensive tests in commands/override_test.go\n\nFixed: CLI parameters now have higher priority than config settings.\n\n**Ticket troveler-iwv: Virtual platform override handling**\n1. commands/install.go: Added ResolveVirtualPlatform() to map mise:* → source platform\n2. Updated override logic to resolve virtual platforms before matching\n3. commands/install_test.go: Added tests for virtual platform resolution\n4. tui/panels/install.go: Added resolveVirtualPlatform() method for TUI panel\n\nFixed: -o mise:github, -o mise:go, -o mise:cargo now work correctly.\n\nAll changes:\n- No new linting issues\n- All existing tests pass\n- All new tests added and passing\n\nPlease assess code quality, maintainability, and patterns.
